## Local Environment â€“ Post-Install Fixes

### 1. Add Flutter & Dart to your PATH
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.zshrc                                                       # reload shell

# Verify
flutter --version
dart --version
```

### 2. Accept Android SDK Licenses
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
# Press `y` to accept each license.
```

Re-run `flutter doctor`; all checks should now pass.
